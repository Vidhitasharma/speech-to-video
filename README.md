# Speech Recognition & Video Command Project

This project uses the `speech_recognition` and `opencv-python` libraries to take spoken input from the user, recognize specific keywords, and play corresponding video files.

## Features

- Recognizes spoken commands such as "namaste," "name," "hobby," "future," and "good day".
- Plays specific video files based on the recognized command.
- Text-to-speech feedback for error handling and guidance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `speech_recognition` library
- `opencv-python` library
- Microphone and compatible video files (e.g., `video1.mp4`, `video2.mp4`, ...)

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
2. Connect a microphone to your computer.
3. Place your video files in the same directory as the scripts.
4. Run the main script:

## Files

- `main.py`: Basic example of speech recognition setup.
- `main2.py`: Main script with command recognition and video display.

## Example Commands

- "namaste" shows `video1.mp4`
- "name" shows `video2.mp4`
- "hobby" shows `video3.mp4`
- "future" shows `video4.mp4`
- "good day" shows `video5.mp4`
